# File-Renamer
Renamer.py renames files to my standard.
# File renamer for the following files:
- yy-mm-ddThhmmH--[NAME]_File_Name.ext
- yy-mm-ddThhmmH--File_Name.ext
- File_Name.ext
- File Name.ext

# # Rename with ISO8601 date format:
- File-Name_[NAME]_yy-mm-ddThhmmH.ext
- File-Name_yy-mm-ddThhmmH.ext

# # # Notes:
- Renames any files not under the exadox format to become the latter.
- Files with brackets will have brackets placed after the File-Name.
- Files that don't contain brackets will not have brackets.
